Things that amount to profit is often the difference between revenue and expenses (overheads and cost of running your biz) and other non-cash assets, such as savings from interest or appreciation of assets over time.
00:36:54	solomonelekwa:	Accounting is more backward-looking, focusing on the accurate recording (book-keeping) and reporting of past financial transactions, while finance is forward-looking, using that data to plan for the future, manage investments, and optimise the company's financial strategy.

Equity is the ownership of your business — who owns what percentage of the company. Hence, when you receive funding for a percentage ownership by the investor - it’s called equity investment as against grants and other non-equity investments.

These are two different ways we classify costs.

Capital/Oerating Exp: Whether the cost is for a long-term asset or investment or for day-to-day running of the business.

Budgeting is pretty similar to what you do at a personal level. Writing down how you plan to spend your resources ie acquire raw material, pay employees etcCash flow forecasting is you predicting how you think money will flow in and out of the business. You typically rely on past data ( if available ) or industry benchmarks if not. Investors will generally be interested in this number to see if you have potential for growth etc.
